##  Sentiment Classification Of Hotel reviews Using Support Vector Machine
In this project i have made a hotel review classification system using svm.
##  Introduction
Hotel reviews are of great importance for customers as well as the hotels and with the tremendous growth of tourism there has been an increase in competition in the hotel industry, hence to stay ahead of their competitors it often becomes necessary for the hotels to analyse the negative reviews they receive and work on them. Therefore, with the ongoing research in sentiment analysis in machine learning we decided to apply this technique to classify hotel reviews as positive or negative ones in this project. We mainly focussed on using support vector machine for this purpose.
